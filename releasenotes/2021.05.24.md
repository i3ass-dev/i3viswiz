Now works correctly with multiple active monitors.  

#### focusing back and forth in the opposite directions feels more intuitive

When **i3viswiz** is used to shift focus in a
direction (left, right, up, down) the current
container ID is noted (`i3var set`). This is done
so that the next time we focus in a direction we
will test if the saved ID is adjacent to the
current container at the searched direction and
focus that if it is the case.

#### less noisy output

when **i3viswiz** is used to output text, it by default
only prints a table representing the visible windows.
It now also prints the workspace number.
And all visible windows from all workspaces not just
the active one. Example:  

```text
$ i3viswiz --instance

* 94475856575600 ws: 1 x: 0     y: 0     w: 1558  h: 410   | termsmall
- 94475856763248 ws: 1 x: 1558  y: 0     w: 362   h: 272   | gl
- 94475856286352 ws: 1 x: 0     y: 410   w: 1558  h: 643   | sublime_main
- 94475856449344 ws: 1 x: 1558  y: 272   w: 362   h: 781   | thunar-lna
```

In previous versions of **i3viswiz** the first
line of this output contained additional
information that is being used by other **i3ass**
scripts. That info is still available, but the
user needs to use the new `--debug VARLIST`
option,  to get that info. See the manpage or
`--help` for more info.
