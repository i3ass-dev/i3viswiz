if the setting "focus_wrapping" is set
to "workspace" in the i3config. i3viswiz will
wrapp the focus only inside the currenttly
focused workspace instead of the whole work
area (other monitors).

The setting has to be present in the active config
before the first i3viswiz invokation.

To force this behavior otherwise, issue the following
command:  
`i3var set focus_wrap workspace`

Or to disable it:  
`i3var set focus_wrap normal`
